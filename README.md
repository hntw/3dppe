# 3DPPE

A public repository of 3D models and associated files for printing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).

I created this project to share files with people who are printing PPE for medical professionals and first responders. This README is a little light at the moment since I am only printing the "Montana Mask" on a single model printer.
