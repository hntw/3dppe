# 3DPPE

A public repository of 3D models and associated files for printing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).

I created this project to share files with people who are printing PPE for medical professionals and first responders. This README is a little light at the moment since I am only printing the "Montana Mask" on a single model printer.

Print-ready files for many of the designs are under print-ready-files (imagine that). Right now the Ender 3 Pro is the focus since that's what I have but I did add files for the XYZprinting Da Vinci Jr. 1.0. More can be added easily. Just ask and I will generate them using Simplify3D.
